            <div>

                <p>My name is Ryan Fisher, and I'm from New Jersey. I've been a musician most of my life, and a good chunk of my life has been centered around music. I've played with groups, played solo, taught lessons, messed around with sound engineering, and tried to familiarize myself with as many musical styles as possible. To make ends meet, I've also worked as a farmer for quite a long time. In the past year, I've decided to switch gears and go back to school. I'm currently attending Raritan Valley Community College, and planning on studying Computer Science. I've been working on learning computer programming in my free time, and I'm really enjoying it so far. I've been mainly using Java to learn, but I've done a little bit with C and Python too. After taking this course, I'm realizing that I really enjoy web design too. I feel like I've developed some skills to build upon, and I'm looking forward to continuing to learn more about designing web pages.</p>

                <p>"First we thought the PC was a calculator. Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters with ASCII - and we thought it was a typewriter. Then we discovered graphics, and we thought it was a television. With the World Wide Web, we've realized it's a brochure." - Douglas Adams</p>

            <h2>An Excerpt From Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</h2>

            <div>
                
                <p>It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits.</p>

                <p>It chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr. Enfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.</p>

                <p>Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least. We shall never see more of Mr. Hyde.”</p>

                <p>“I hope not,” said Utterson. “Did I ever tell you that I once saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?”</p>

                <p>It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Enfield. “And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll’s! It was partly your own fault that I found it out, even when I did.”</p>

                <p>“So you found it out, did you?” said Utterson. “But if that be so, we may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if the presence of a friend might do him good.”</p>

                <p>The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.</p>

                <p>“What! Jekyll!” he cried. “I trust you are better.”</p>

                <p>“I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low. It will not last long, thank God.”</p>
