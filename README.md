## Description

This project involved building a website from the ground up to serve as a "virtual business card". In the course of working on this project, I learned how to:

- properly name and organize files and folders for web development
- write the initial HTML
- add images and links
- use Github for version control
- remember to CPR (Commit, Push, Refresh)
- use Netlify to deploy the site
- style the content with CSS
- pick an appropriate color scheme while keeping readability in mind
- use the Box Model to organize content
- create dynamic layouts using Flexbox and Grid
- use responsive design and media queries to make the site look good on different screen sizes
- embed a youtube video in the site
- add a contact form
- create a navigation bar
- use comments appropriately to document my code
- create a hamburger icon
- create a README file using markdown

The fonts used are Josefin Sans and Yeseva One. The font in the RF logo is Passion One.
